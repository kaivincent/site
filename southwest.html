                    <h1>Southwest</h1>
                    <p>In the summer of 2022, I had the great privilege of interning with the Innovation Team at Southwest Airlines' headquarters in Dallas, Texas.</p>
                    <p>At the time, the Team served as an internal consultancy, working with operations-facing departments across the company to leverage Human-centered design and instill an innovation mindset. With work ranging from localized continuous improvement initiatives to system-wide research &amp; development projects, I was able to see a wide variety of operational environments and worked with countless Employees and Customers over the course of my internship.</p>
