                    <h1>USC ITE</h1>
                    <p>Serving as the University of Southern California's chapter of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, USC ITE is a community of transportation engineers, planners, policy experts, and more. The diverse academic and industry interests among the student members is complemented by a variety of meetings, guest speakers, technical tours, and conferences that allow members to learn and connect with other students and professionals in the transportation community.</p>
                    <p>As the Communications Chair, I had the great privilege of sharing our chapter's activities with internal and external audiences through several mediums. From a logo refresh to content creation in still images and video interviews to editing, copywriting, and publishing on our channels—including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/usc.ite" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/uscite/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://iteusc.com" target="_blank">web</a>—it has been very rewarding to coordinate our content strategy!</p>

                    <p>One particular project that was fun to launch was asking each of our guest speakers and technical tour hosts for a quick (~60 second) interview to learn about what inspired them to get involved in transportation and what motivates them to continue working in the industry. Here is an example with the Deputy Executive Director of Planning &amp; Development at the Hollywood-Burbank Airport (BUR).</p>
